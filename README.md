Project Description: The Daily Expense Tracker is a simple C program that helps users record, view, and manage their daily expenses. Users can add expense details such as the name, amount, and date, view all recorded expenses, calculate total spending, and save the data to a text file for future reference. This program is designed for students and beginners to practice file handling, arrays, structures, and basic C programming concepts in a practical scenario.
